## Title 
### StudyZone

## Introduction 
We propose to develop a study planner for university students who have trouble managing their time. In order to help students simply keep track of their homework or deadlines, we are working on projects for them that will incorporate notes, flashcards, and class information. Study trackers were also added so that students could focus entirely on the assignments they wished to complete rather than getting distracted by other tasks.

## Objective 
This project's goal is to examine each person's preferred learning method and give an analysis on how much time the student can concentrate. Alternatively, to evaluate students' dedication. Make sure to block off time on the student calendar for all of their classes, obligations at work, and extracurricular activities. Additionally, students should schedule study time for each topic. It is to estimate how much time students will need to dedicate to each subject they wish to study. Furthermore, a student planner is used to create a schedule allowing them to choose which days they have available for study. Moreover, students can plan their study time according to their preferred methods of learning.
